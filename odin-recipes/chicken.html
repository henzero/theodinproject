		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<li>
			<ul>
				4 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
			</ul>
			<ul>
				2 tablespoons olive oil
			</ul>
			<ul>
				½ teaspoon coarse sea salt, or to taste
			</ul>
			<ul>

			</ul>
			<ul>

			</ul>

		<h3>Directions</h3>
		<li></li>
		<ol>
			Gather all ingredients.
		</ol>
		<ol>
			Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
		</ol>
		<ol>
			Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle both sides with salt and Creole seasoning. Place chicken in a
			broiler pan.
		</ol>
		<ol>
			Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center and the
			juices run clear, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at
			least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
		</ol>
		<ol>
			Remove chicken to a plate.
		</ol>
		<ol>
			Pour chicken broth into the pan and scrape any browned bits off the bottom with a flat-edged wooden spatula.
			Add more broth if needed to dislodge the browned bits, but not too much or it will be watery.
		</ol>
		<ol>
			To serve, drizzle the pan sauce over the chicken.
		</ol>
